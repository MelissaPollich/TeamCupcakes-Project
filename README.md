To play one of the three word searches, either click on one of the blue buttons or select one from the "Levels" drop down menu in the navigation bar.

Once in a level, you will see the word search (letters in a grid). To guess a word that you have found, enter it in the text field below the word grid and press the guess button. If you guess a word correctly the “Words Remaining” counter to the left of the text field will decrement and the word you guessed will appear between the word grid and the text field. This is to help you remember the words you have found. While playing, or after you have finished, a word search, you can go back to the main menu by clicking the “Home” button or play one of the other word searches by selecting on from the from the “Levels” dropdown menu in the navigation bar. Upon completion of a word search the words that you have found will turn green and the "Words Remaining" will have reached zero.
