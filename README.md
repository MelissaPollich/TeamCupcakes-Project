Game title: Word Finder

This project is about the never ending search for words. Just kidding, that's too deep and philosophical. Winder Finder is a word search game that contains three word searches that you, the user can play.

If you are new to this game, launch the create_profile.html file to create a profile (If you are a returning launch the login.html file to login to your profile). Once you have created a profile you will be taken to the login page where you will be prompted for your username and password.

After logging in you will be taken to the main menu for the game. The navigation bar at the top of the screen contains a button to bring you back to the home screen, a drop down menu for selecting levels, you username, your total score from all of the word searches, and a logout button. To play on of the three word searches, either click on one of the blue buttons or select one from the "Levels" drop down menu in the navigation bar.

Once in a level, you will see the word search (letters in a grid). To guess a word that you have found, enter it in the text field below the word grid and press the guess button. If you guess a word correctly the “Words Remaining” counter to the left of the text field will decrement and the word you guessed will appear between the word grid and the text field. This is to help you remember the words you have found. Guessing words correctly will increase you score, which can be seen on the right side of the navigation bar next to your username. While playing, or after you have finished, a word search, you can go back to the main menu by clicking the “Home” button or selecting another word search from the “Levels” dropdown menu in the navigation bar.

When you are done playing the game you can click on the “Logout” button on the left side of the navigation bar.
